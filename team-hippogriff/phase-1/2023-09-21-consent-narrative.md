Hello! We're a team of user experience design students at Olin College of Engineering in Needham aiming to make technology more user-friendly for older adults. Our project focuses on simplifying the digital experience, whether it's navigating smartphone features or managing passwords and logins. We've partnered with North Hill Retirement Community for this study, and we'd love to have a chat with you.

Your firsthand insights would be invaluable in helping us understand what works for you and what doesn't when it comes to technology. There are no risks involved, just a few brief interviews. Plus, you'll have a direct impact on creating a more accessible digital world!

For any questions or concerns, feel free to contact us at [email]. Our head faculty, Amon Millner, can also be reached at amillner@olin.edu. We appreciate your time and look forward to hopefully working with you!
