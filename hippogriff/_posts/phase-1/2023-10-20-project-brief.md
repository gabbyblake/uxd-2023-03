excerpt: "We're helping older adults use technology; here's why and how"
---
In a digital age where new technology continually floods the market, a segment of the population finds themselves struggling to keep up—older adults aged 65 and up. The crux of the issue isn't just the rapid technological advances but also the UX design that doesn't accommodate this demographic's unique needs. Today, technology expects prerequisite experience that many older adults just don’t have. Therefore, things the technology-literate do without thought—like navigating the labyrinth of smartphone apps and picking through the myriad of cables and buttons become insurmountable barriers to entry. It hampers their ability to fully utilize digital tools that could, in fact, make their lives easier and more connected.

Our goal is to bridge this gap by redesigning the user experience to be more intuitive for older adults. We're not just talking about making font sizes bigger (the status quo for designing for older adults); we're digging deeper to simplify and innovate how this demographic interacts with technology.

For instance, one of our early design sketches focuses on an app that identifies cable types through a simple photo. This is an example of a small but meaningful step in reducing the day-to-day tech-related frustrations that older adults face.

Data gathering is crucial for identifying the specific pain points of our target audience. We'll be partnering with the North Hill Retirement Community to get firsthand insights from volunteers who are keen to share their digital struggles and successes. We'll run interviews and possibly usability tests to refine our understanding and approach. These interactions will help our team to gather valuable insights into usability issues, preferences, and what the learning curve looks like for our people group.

As for the dynamics of our team, we've planned weekly meetings outside of class to ensure we're all on the same page. We'll also stay connected through text and Discord and use Google Drive for collaboration on project files. While we're aware that we don't have all the answers right now, we plan to meet with older adults to gather the necessary insights.
