**What is your design?**

Our design concept aims to address the challenge of forging new friendships in a new city for young professionals, particularly those working remotely. 
The current reality for remote workers often involves extended periods of solitude as they adapt to a new environment. While in-office employees have 
opportunities to cultivate connections through their workplace, remote young professionals must seek companions who are at a similar stage in life 
through other methods. One such method is using dating apps to make friends, which confuses those who use these platforms exclusively for romantic 
purposes. Our app offers a solution by providing a dedicated platform for individuals seeking new connections within their city, with an emphasis on 
platonic relationships and shared experiences. We started our design process with individual sketches, which we then shared in a team meeting. After going 
through everyone’s designs, we discussed what we liked about them and chose a primary design to move forward with. We then took the style of that design and 
created feature sketches of the chat function of our app. After sharing those sketches, we again chose one to move forward with and began implementing our 
designs in Figma. While creating our designs in Figma, we began to decide on a color scheme and fonts and began to figure out the organization of all the elements 
that needed to be part of our design. Our Figma can be accessed [here](https://www.figma.com/file/ah5c2ECtIDtREyY2t8G8or/UXD?type=design&node-id=1%3A2&mode=design&t=mj0mnKsVbMR9nuIN-1).

**How does it work?**

Our app works by presenting users with potential social events happening near them. The user can cater the events they see to their interests by specifying 
preferences, and select which events they want to attend. They then can join a chat with other users also interested in that event, allowing them to talk to 
and hang out with people with similar passions. While other apps are limited only to “matching” people together, often resulting in no actual conversation besides 
icebreakers or a ‘hello,’ our format allows users to jump right to the stage of prepping to go to an activity and meet people in advance. Users will be able to 
successfully get out and meet more people, as the activation energy is much lower than trying to pick and choose between people who you have to make plans with from scratch. 

**How well does it meet user needs? In what ways does it fall short?**

Our user-centric app is designed to cater to a wide range of needs. It empowers users to create comprehensive profiles that include photos, personal information, interests,
and a brief bio, ensuring they can express themselves fully. Our matching algorithm goes a step further, suggesting potential friends based on events and interests. We give users the 
ability to fine-tune their preferences with our unique “bubbles” feature, allowing them to increase or decrease their social interest according to their comfort level. We enable secure 
messaging within the app, providing a safe environment for users to communicate with potential friends via text messaging. Additionally, our app fosters a sense of community by allowing 
users to join or create groups and communities based on their interests and hobbies, thus fostering shared passions and meaningful connections. Our system also includes a feature that 
encourages users to leave reviews of their experience with the app, as well as their thoughts on its features and user experience. This feedback loop helps us continuously improve and provide 
a better service to our users. To keep users engaged, we've incorporated gamification elements such as the use of “bubbles” to incentivize continued participation and interaction. However, we 
acknowledge that there are some shortcomings in our app. It requires an additional download, which might be a minor inconvenience for some users. Furthermore, we understand that individuals 
with dexterity problems might face challenges when using the app – using the pinching motion to make a bubble bigger or smaller – and actively working to make it more accessible to all. 

**What important alternative designs did you consider, either initially or during the refinement of this idea? Why did you reject them/prefer the one you chose?** 

Initially, we were thinking of a more traditional people-matching app, but, after gathering some information about our user group’s experiences with dating apps and friendship apps formatted, 
we decided to pivot. There are a lot of underlying expectations and biases directing people’s use of people-matching apps. Often things like someone’s appearance, or how funny their bio one-liner
is, completely sways a user’s opinion of them- even if they’re just looking for new friends near them. This inhibits users who struggle to represent themselves through pictures- or even don’t 
want to post pictures of themselves publicly online- and a few brief words from matching with others. By matching people with events, there's less pressure on users to try to present themselves 
“desirably” to get matches. Their profiles can be tailored to however they are comfortable presenting themselves as opposed to needing to fit into the tastes of those they want to match since it’s 
about choosing events- not people. It also mitigates users' biases surrounding appearance matching even if unintentional out of habit from using dating apps rather than friend-finding apps. 

**What key insights did you gain in trying to produce a design that addresses your brief?**

Building and maintaining meaningful friendships is fundamentally rooted in the shared experiences and memories we create with others. It’s not just about meeting new people, but about what we do together. 
Rather than solely focusing on the question, “Who can I meet today?” it’s often more rewarding to consider, “What am I doing today?” The quality and depth of a friendship are often a reflection of the time 
spent together and the moments shared. It’s about valuing the present moment and the connections you already have rather than solely seeking out new people to meet. It’s important to engage in activities and
experiences with people, rather than reducing them to mere social connections. It’s a reminder to value individuals for who they are and not just for their potential utility in expanding your social network. 
People appreciate interactive and engaging experiences with others, as genuine interaction, participation in activities, and meaningful conversations are key elements in building strong and lasting friendships. 
In essence, friendships are formed and nurtured through the bonds created by experiencing life together.
